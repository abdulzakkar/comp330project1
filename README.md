### 9/18/17
+ Today, we decided to create a system for the user to control file input and output.
+ The notes.py program takes a directory argument in which all the notes are found.
+ The user can build an output from the program using available tools, each of which is written in a different py file.
+ If the user only wants to see the results of two tools, 
it is possible to select only those tools and quit out of the program to view the results.
+ We wrote the second tool, which is to organize notes by mention called organize_by_mention.py.
+ To do:
1. There are four remaining tools to build (3,4,5,6).
2. Consider improving format of output.
3. The output file can be placed in a location selected by the user, and named as per the user's liking.
4. We need to set up a Trello project and record communications and history through it.

### 9/19/17
+ Today, we set up the keyword collection system.
+ Keywords are words that appear in the set of notes at least 3 times.
+ Certain words are filtered out from becoming keywords (words like 'the' and 'of').
+ Such words are compiled and stored in boring_words_filtered.txt
+ To do:
1. Search for word tool
2. organize by keywords tool
3. topologically organize tool
4. improve UI
