I set up the github and cloud 9 and added the sample notes files to the directory in cloud 9.

9/16/17
Today, we got Katie connected to the github through cloud9, and now both Abdul and Katie are collaborators in the project. 
Also, notes.py file now has one function which can report all the mentions present in each file.
The functionality was added into the file report_mentions.py, we will continue to separate different functions into individual py files.
To do:
1. is done
2. Abdul first
3. Katie first
4. Katie second
5. Abdul second
6. We'll see
